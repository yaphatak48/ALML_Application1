- using size operator to get total count in a column
- extracting the data using string manupulation functions like startswith,
  conatins 

#Calculated the proportion of the total people chose to accept the coupon
using data analysis techniques like querying the subset of data
percentage of people/drivers who accepted any kind of coupon is 56.84326710816777 %


Calculated % of bar coupons accepted. Portion of bar coupons accepted
41.00148735746158 %

76.88442211055276 %


Compared the acceptance rate between drivers who go to a bar more than once a
month and are over the age of 25 to the all others using various data analysis

Portion of people who went more than once to Bar & above age 25 and accepted
coupon 69.93865030674846 %
Portion of people who went more than once to Bar & below age 25 and accepted

Conclusion: There is not much difference between acceptance rate between
drivers who go to a bar more than once a month and are over the age of 25 to

drivers who go to bars atleast once a month has ~71% chance of accepting the Bar coupon.

Passangers, marital status or age doesn't affect the acceptance rate that much.
